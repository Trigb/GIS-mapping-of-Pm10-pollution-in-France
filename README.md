- **Geographical Scale**  
  The analysis is conducted at the level of **Cantons** in France, which correspond to districts within French regions.

- **Administrative Data**  
  Official French administrative data was sourced from the [French Government Open Data Platform](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/).

- **Pollution Data**  
  Air pollutant concentration data is provided by the [European Environment Agency (EEA)](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/datahub/datahubitem-view/82700fbd-2953-467b-be0a78a520c3a7ef).  
  This dataset combines observational measurements with a **regression–interpolation–merging mapping** methodology to produce consistent and comprehensive pollution estimates.
